## API

> The Zabbix API allows you to programmatically retrieve and modify configuration of Zabbix and provides access to historical data. The Zabbix API is an HTTP-based API, and it is shipped as a part of the web frontend. It uses the JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol.

## Notifications and Alerts

> You would not want to stare at the triggers or events list all the time. It would be much better to receive notification if something significant (such as a problem) has happened. Also, when problems occur, you would like to see that all the people concerned are informed.

- [official-docs](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/en/manual/config/notifications) - Notifications upon events. ðŸ”´

## SNMP

> Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an Internet Standard protocol for collecting and organizing information about managed devices on IP networks and for modifying that information to change device behaviour. Devices that typically support SNMP include cable modems, routers, switches, servers, workstations, printers, and more.

## Templates

> Templates is an excellent way of reducing one's workload and streamlining the Zabbix configuration. A template is a set of entities that can be conveniently applied to multiple hosts.

## Triggers

> Triggers are logical expressions that "evaluate" data gathered by items and represent the current system state. Trigger expressions allow to define a threshold of what state of data is "acceptable". Therefore, should the incoming data surpass the acceptable state, a trigger is "fired" - or changes its state to PROBLEM.

- [official-docs](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/en/manual/config/triggers) - Zabbix Trigger documentation. ðŸ”´
- [baseline-and-anomaly](https://mpolinowski.github.io/docs/DevOps/Zabbix/2022-01-16--zabbix-v6-baseline-monitoring/2022-01-16c) - Creating triggers for Baseline monitoring and Anomaly detection.
